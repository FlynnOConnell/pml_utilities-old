```

**Note:**
- `-e/--ext` needs the leading dot: `.zarr`, not `zarr`.
- `-p/--planes`, `-t/--timepoints`, and `-c/--channels` are repeatable; pass each value separately (`-p 4 -p 5`), not `4 5` or `4,5,6`.
- `-t/--timepoints` selects specific timepoints; `--num-timepoints` limits to the first N. (`-n/--num-frames` is a deprecated alias for `--num-timepoints`.)
- `--roi 0` (split) and `--roi "1,3"` (multiple) write each ROI to its own `roiNN/` subdirectory. `--roi N` selects one ROI; omitting `--roi` stitches all ROIs into one FOV.
- Zarr-only options (`--compressor`, `--compression-level`, `--sharded`, `--pyramid*`) are ignored for other formats. `--dataset-name` applies to `.h5` only.

## Init

Create starter notebooks (mbo + LBM-Suite2p user guides).

```bash
mbo init                       # notebooks in current directory
mbo init /path/to/raw          # notebooks in /path/to/scripts, data path filled in
mbo init /path/to/raw -o ./nb  # custom destination directory
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-o, --output` | Destination directory (overrides default location) |
| `--overwrite` | Overwrite existing notebooks |

With a `DATA_PATH` argument, notebooks are written to a `scripts/` directory beside the data and the data path is pre-filled. Without it, notebooks go in the current directory with default paths.

## Shortcut

Create a desktop icon that opens the GUI.

```bash
mbo shortcut                  # "Miller Brain Studio"
mbo shortcut --name "MBO"     # custom name
```

```
Created: C:/Users/RBO/Desktop/MBO.lnk

## Linescan

Per-ROI traces from the AOD line-scan units of a Femtonics `.mesc` file. Each
line drawn on the reference Z-stack is its own ROI; its kymograph is averaged
over the line (cropped to the line's true, unpadded extent) into one trace per
timepoint. Ribbon, chessboard, Z-stack and other units in the file are skipped.

```bash
mbo linescan scan.mesc                                  # every linescan unit
mbo linescan scan.mesc -o results/linescan              # keep the raw folder untouched
mbo linescan scan.mesc --unit MUnit_3 --channel 1       # one unit, second channel
mbo linescan scan.mesc --dfof-window 2 --no-dfof        # baseline window in seconds
```

Outputs one directory per unit, `rois_linescan/<MUnit_n>/` beside the file (or
`<output>/<MUnit_n>/`):

| file | contents |
|------|----------|
| `F.npy` | K x T mean over each line, in the file's converted counts (zero = no photons; MESc's raw uint16 sit ~1000 counts above that, which left in makes every dF/F several times too small) |
| `F_chan<c>.npy` | the same for every other channel (the red structural channel next to the green functional one) |
| `dfof.npy` | rolling max-min baseline dF/F, window in seconds so kHz line rates get the same seconds as a raster movie; stim frames bridged |
| `kymographs.npy`, `kymographs_chan<c>.npy` | K x bins x W position-along-line x time, 10 ms bins (NaN beyond a narrower line's width) |
| `stim_frames.npy` | frames acquired while a photostimulation pattern was active (from the `PatternSeq_AO1` curve, the rule lab4 uses); the scanner reads low on these, so derived traces bridge them |
| `stat.npy` | per ROI: `roi_index`, `height`, `width`, `npix`, plus `f0`, `peak_dfof`, `time_to_peak_s`, `response_auc`, `noise_dfof`, `snr` (stimulus-aligned when there is a stimulus, whole-run otherwise) |
| `ops.npy` | `roi_workflow` holds fs, channels, stim onsets/durations/pulse count, the paired reference Z-stack and the channel conversion used |
| `Fneu.npy`, `spks.npy`, `iscell.npy`, `rois.json` | suite2p-shaped placeholders so `mbo info` and lsp tools still open the directory |

A ROI whose baseline is at or below zero is reported as unreliable rather than
silently written.

The numbered figures read in order, like the suite2p and masknmf sets:

| figure | what to look for |
|--------|------------------|
| `01a_background_snapshot_lines.png` | every line on the raster snapshot it was drawn on (the unit's `BackgroundImagePath`, taken seconds before the scan), composite plus each channel; lines more than 1 um off that plane are dashed |
| `01b_reference_zstack_lines.png` | the lines on the paired Z-stack, one panel per slice that carries lines; the dot is the line start. The stack is the finest one whose field holds the lines and that puts at least 10 pixels along a line (a whole-cell stack never qualifies while a dendrite stack exists). A line scanned outside the stack's depth range is dashed with a `!`, drawn on the nearest slice, and its offset is in the title |
| `01c_line_zooms.png` | an 8 um crop around every line, each channel, local contrast, from the snapshot or the stack slice at the line's depth: the line should cross a bright spine or shaft. This is the panel to check first when an overlay looks wrong |

The micron-to-pixel convention (translation = the array's corner, rows grow
with +y, no mirror) was verified on real data: 36 of 40 in-plane lines are
brighter than random same-shaped lines nearby, the mirrored mapping is at
chance. `--flip-y` remains for a rig that saves the other way round.
| `02_line_profiles.png` | time-averaged counts along each line, both channels, shared y-axis: a bump is a spine, a flat line at background missed |
| `03a_kymographs_green.png`, `03b_kymographs_red.png` | position x time per ROI, stimulus marked |
| `04a_traces_raw.png`, `04b_traces_dfof.png` | stacked per-ROI traces over the run |
| `05_stim_response.png` | stimulus-aligned dF/F (F0 = 1 s before onset): ROI x time heatmap, every ROI, mean +/- s.e.m. |
| `06_roi_response_metrics.png` | per-ROI F0 (both channels), peak dF/F, latency, noise, SNR, response integral |
| `07_motion_correction.png` | the AOD's real-time motion correction in X/Y/Z over the run |

`--no-figures` skips them.

`mbo scan.mesc` opens the image viewer on the file's first line-scan unit
with no unit prompt. The viewer has no curation panel of its own: with
vnoiser installed, the Voltage pipeline's **Curate** button (and File >
Curate) opens the curation window below in its own process, on the
experiment's `PF` folder when one sits beside the file, else on the file
itself with every line of its line-scan units as a raw recording that the
wavelet denoiser runs on when clicked. The Voltage pipeline is on the
Process tab. `mbo <expt>`
or `mbo <expt>/PF` opens the folder the same way: `imread` returns a
`ResultsArray` for any run's output, like a suite2p output folder, whose
image is the recording it came from (named in `pipeline.json`, or laid out
beside it as `<expt>/<expt>/<expt>.mesc`) or, without that file, a raster of
the denoised traces. The curation dashboard on its own, with no image, is
`mbo curate PATH` (`python -m mbo_utilities.gui.curation_viewer PATH` from
a script): it takes a `PF` folder (or the experiment folder holding it, or
a line scan with one beside it), lists every scan / domain trace in it and
shows the trace and its candidates over the template, focused candidate
and PCA, one recording at a time with arrows to flip, and the recordings
table beside it. Labels are keyed `scan=<id>/domain=<name>` in
`PF/.curation/<mode>_template_curation.json`.

The window's `guide` button (`h`), and the `vnoiser guide` button at the top of
the Voltage pipeline, open the vnoiser guide: one page of diagrams and tables on
what each stage does to a trace, the Voltage window and its domain table, the
curation window's panels and four rules, and the files a run leaves.
`python -m mbo_utilities.gui.imgui.vnoiser_help` opens it on its own.

To curate from another machine, serve the dashboard instead of opening a
window: `mbo curate PATH --serve` (or `python -m mbo_utilities.gui.curation_server
PATH`) renders it where the data and the GPU are and streams it to any browser
that opens the printed URL (default `http://localhost:60649/`); pointer and key
events go back the same way, so nothing is installed on the laptop. Every
connected browser sees the same frames and the longest-connected one drives.
There is no login: leave `--host` on localhost and tunnel
(`ssh -L 60649:localhost:60649 server`), or front it with an authenticating
proxy; `--host 0.0.0.0` opens it to the network as is.

To scrub the lines on the stack instead, run `mbo linescan scan.mesc --view`
(or `mbo linescan <expt> --view`): three panels on top (the
line-scan itself, the snapshot the lines were drawn on, the paired Z-stack)
and the curation dashboard, scoped to the scan on screen, on the strip
above them. The Z-stack picker shows every
stack's fit (fraction of lines in its field and depth range, pixel size)
and defaults to the paired one; a stack holding none of the lines is
refused. `--dry-run` prints the choice and placement without a window,
`--screenshot out.png` renders the window offscreen.

## Voltage

The spatial JEDI pipeline (Noguchi & Terada) on a `.mesc` with AOD ROI units,
producing the `PF` folder the curation window reads. A unit's ROIs are the
lines of a line scan or the patches of a chessboard or ribbon scan; each unit
is one scan. Each ROI's mean fluorescence per frame is read as above, the ROIs
of a domain (the soma, one branch, one cell's patch) are averaged
pixel-weighted, dF/F and a sign-flipped z-score follow, then vnoiser's wavelet
denoiser with the archive's settings, then the peak detector. The settings
are written for the archive's 1075 Hz line scans; the parameters counted in
samples are scaled to each scan's frame rate and the peak band-pass is capped
below Nyquist, so a 200 Hz chessboard scan keeps the same baseline durations.
One run takes scans of one frame rate.

```bash
mbo voltage stan112_expt12.mesc --init                      # domains.json template beside the file
mbo voltage stan112_expt12.mesc                             # every scan in domains.json
mbo voltage stan112_expt12.mesc --unit MUnit_35 -o PF_new   # one scan, elsewhere
mbo voltage stan112_expt12.mesc --domains PF/scanIDs_ROIs.pkl --overwrite
mbo voltage stan112_expt12.mesc -p 1 -p 2 -p 3              # only ROIs 1-3 (the unit's Z axis); domains are cut down to them
mbo curate X:/data/asako/stan112/stan112_expt12             # then curate it
```

`domains.json` names the domains and their 0-based ROI indices (lines or
patches, in drawing order), the scans in order and the first scan of each
environment. `--init` writes one domain per ROI (`roi0: [0]`, ...); merge
the lines of a soma or branch by hand, as the archive's layout below does:

```json
{"domains": {"soma1": [0, 1, 2], "basal1": [3, 4, 5]}, "scans": ["35", "38"], "first_env": ["35"]}
```

Written to `<expt>/PF` for the archive layout
(`<expt>/<expt>/<expt>.mesc`), else `PF` beside the file:

| file | contents |
|------|----------|
| `denoised_trace_scans.pkl` | `{scan: {domain: trace}}`, the trace the curation window shows (the masked wavelet sum, no baseline) |
| `fs_scans.pkl`, `scanIDs_ROIs.pkl` | frame rate (rounded down, as the archive stored it) and the scan / domain / ROI tables |
| `detected_events_peaks.pkl`, `param_spike_detect.pkl` | peaks per domain and the thresholds (`--events LO,HI,BP_SD,AMP_SD,DUR_MS`) |
| `denoised_trace_components.pkl`, `test.h5` | the masked sum, 1 Hz / 100 Hz baselines and envelope; per-domain dF/F and z |
| `cwts.h5` | the wavelet coefficients, only with `--save-cwt` (large) |
| `pipeline.json` | provenance: source file and units, every parameter, versions, ROI pixel weights, the run's `timing` (below) and its `processing_history` (one `voltage_<step>` entry per step with `duration_seconds`, CPU seconds and memory, the shape suite2p's `ops.npy` uses) |
| `timings.json` | the run's timing on its own: wall and CPU seconds, peak process memory, `totals` per step, `denoise_stages` (the denoiser's `cwt`, `cluster`, `reduce`, `mask`, `baseline`, `baseline_100hz` and `peaks` summed over domains), per scan the read and each domain's dF/F and denoising, and one flat row per step (`steps`; a denoise row carries its stages as `<stage>_s`) |
| `traces/` | the same results as plain files, see below |

Every step is logged as it runs, the way the suite2p pipeline reports its
planes: the read of each ROI, each domain's dF/F, each domain's denoising with
its event count and the seconds of each stage inside it, then the writes, each
closed by one line with its wall time, CPU time and the process's memory
(current, the step's peak, the system's share), and a summary line at the end
with the totals per step and per denoiser stage. On a 476k-frame line scan at
1587 Hz a domain's wavelet transform takes about 4 s and its whole denoising
about 10 s; the dF/F baselines take about 12 s per domain and the read about
20 s per 15 ROIs. `mbo
voltage` prints them with a clock; the Run tab's worker writes them to the
process console's log, where its progress bar follows every ROI read and every
domain denoised. The same record is the `timing` in `pipeline.json`, the
results zarr's `provenance` and `ResultsArray.metadata`, so a notebook can
compare runs without the log.

`--zarr` (the Run tab's **Output format**, the default) writes the results as
one `<stem>.<stamp>.voltage.zarr` file beside the input instead of a PF folder
of pickles, the shape every pipeline's results share
(`mbo_utilities.results`). One group per scan holds the `denoised`, `dff` and
`zscore` traces `(ROI, frame)`, the lines of each ROI, the lines' `raw` traces
and the detected events; `read_results(path)` reads it back and `imread` opens
it as a `ResultsArray`. `test.h5`, `traces/`, `pipeline.json` and
`timings.json` are written either way: inside the results file in a `voltage/`
folder named after the pipeline, or loose in the PF folder with `--pkl`.
The curation window opens either. `mbo results PATH` converts an
existing PF, suite2p or masknmf folder the same way. In the viewer, "Load
into Traces" on the Voltage tab (or loading the file as a run in Manual ROI
Labeling) puts every scan's denoised and line traces in the Traces tab; a
finished zarr-format run started from the Process tab is picked up there on
its own.

`PF/traces/` needs only numpy and pandas to read
(`demos/voltage_results.ipynb` walks through it). Row `i` of every
`(domain, frame)` array is row `i` of `domains.csv`:

| file | contents |
|------|----------|
| `scans.csv` | scan id, MESc unit, frame rate, frames, ROIs |
| `domains.csv` | row index, domain name, ROI indices |
| `scan<id>_rois.npy` | raw mean fluorescence, `(ROI, frame)` |
| `scan<id>_dfof.npy`, `scan<id>_zscore.npy`, `scan<id>_denoised.npy` | dF/F, z-score and denoised trace per domain, `(domain, frame)` |
| `scan<id>_peaks.csv` | detected events: domain, frame, time in seconds |
| `scan<id>_denoised.png`, `scan<id>_rois.png` | the denoised domains with their events, and the raw ROIs, stacked |

Events labelled in the curation window land in `PF/.curation/<mode>_template_curation.json`
(`events`: recording, `source_event_index`, `source_event_time_s`, `label`).

Run on `stan112_expt12`'s raw scans with the archive's `scanIDs_ROIs.pkl`, the
output reproduces the archive's PF traces to float precision (the peaks on 7 of
16 domains exactly, the rest with one to nine extra borderline events); the
conversion is left off (`--convert` applies the file's offset so zero means no
photons, which the archive never did).

The same pipeline is the **Voltage** entry of the viewer's Process tab (`mbo
scan.mesc`, or `mbo <expt>/PF` to run it again on a folder's source scan): the dataset block, output folder, slice popup
(a frame window and the channel; every line is used), a Scans block ticking
which units become scans, a Domains table naming which lines make each domain
(loaded from or saved to `domains.json`, seeded from a `PF` folder beside the
file when one exists), the settings popup with the archive's values as
defaults, and Run, which spawns a worker the process console tracks: its
progress follows each ROI read and each domain denoised, and its log lists
every step with its time and memory. **Curate** opens the curation window
(`mbo curate`, its own process) on the folder once it is written, before
that on the file's raw lines. The curation window only reads results: every
scan of the PF folder is listed, and a scan that went through motion
correction (the AOD's RTMC) shows it over the candidate trace on the same time
axis behind the `MC` checkbox. `mbo scan.mesc` opens on the first scan the folder holds.
