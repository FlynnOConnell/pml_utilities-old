    One trace per axis on the recording's own time axis: ``traces`` maps a
    label to ``(t, shift)``, ``t`` in seconds from the start of the recording
    and ``shift`` in ``unit``. A label starts with its axis letter (``"X"``,
    ``"Z layer 3"``) so a consumer can colour by axis. ``source`` names the
    stage the way a plot shows it: ``"RTMC"`` for the AOD's real-time
    correction (``MescArray.motion_correction``, in µm); a registration's
    per-frame offsets (suite2p's ``xoff`` / ``yoff``, masknmf's shifts, in px)
    take the same shape. ``planes`` maps a label to the z-plane its trace
    belongs to, for a stage that ran on each plane alone (suite2p registers a
    volume plane by plane); a label it leaves out applies to every plane.
