"""Manual ROI drawing + labeling widget for the viewer.

Toggled from ``Widgets > Manual ROI Labeling`` in the preview GUI (``mbo
<path> --widget manualroi`` opens with it on). The ROIs tab of the
right-hand widget (``widgets/tabs.py``) holds the control sections -
NAVIGATE, DRAW, VIEW, LABELS, each gated by its Widgets-menu subwidget
toggle - over a status row and the combined ROI table; the Traces tab holds
the trace table. The trace plot and its controls are a panel on the
figure's top strip, which has the width for it. No tab or panel is ever
selected for the user. Running ROIs is the Process tab's business: its ``ROIs``
pipeline (``widgets/pipelines/rois.py``) reads this widget's model. The
table, label set, stroke capture, overlay compositing and theme are the
shared widgets from ``mbo_utilities.gui.imgui``.

The state is a :class:`~mbo_utilities.annotation.RoiModel`: the
``RoiLabelStore`` (one ``(P, Y, X)`` uint16 label volume, 0 background, ROI
``i`` is ``i + 1``, so masks never overlap; each ROI keeps a persistent
``uid`` and a ``source`` naming where it came from), the
``RoiTraceTable`` (one row per measurement, keyed by ROI uid, z-plane,
channel and engine) and the slider position. The widget subscribes to the
model's events and redraws from them, so the same model drives the
Process tab's ROI pipeline without either widget polling the other.

Arm "Add ROI" (a), drag a closed stroke around a cell, release and the
enclosed pixels become a mask; with ``auto_trace`` on (the default) its
mean trace is computed at once and the Traces panel shows it. A stroke
lands on the exact slice the viewer shows: every scrolling dim except time
(z, channel, any extra slider) keys its own plane of masks, and flipping a
slider swaps the overlays, table filter and traces to that slice's ROIs.
Data without scroll sliders degrades to a single plane. Annotations
autosave next to the data as an OME-NGFF-style labels zarr
(``manual_labels.zarr``, see ``mbo_utilities.annotation``) and are restored
from it on relaunch. A file holding several recordings (a ``.mesc``) gets
one per recording (``manual_labels_MSession_0_MUnit_3.zarr``; the run
registry and run dirs likewise), and switching recordings swaps the whole
widget, so the ROIs, runs and traces on screen are always the shown one's.

Runs read an ROI's mask where it was drawn and its pixels wherever the
Process tab points them (``run_z`` / ``run_c`` / ``run_tp``, "as
drawn" by default), through :meth:`run_rois`, writing ``rois_<tag>/``
beside the data; a run of the same ROI at the same coordinates with the
same engine replaces its row. Region detection (r) and full-plane suite2p
/ masknmf runs load their outputs as derived sets - a second overlay plus
rows in the table - whose components can be promoted into the drawn store
(y) or discarded (n). Loaded runs are remembered in a ``roi_runs.json``
sidecar and restored on relaunch.

Masks draw as shaded footprints by default (VIEW, or o to cycle), so a
freshly drawn ROI is visible at once. "circle" rings each ROI without
covering it and "outline" traces its own border; these vector modes are
line geometry, so the stroke stays a hairline however far in you zoom.

With drawing off, clicking selects what is under the cursor - a derived
component when its overlay shows there, else the drawn ROI - and clicking
the background clears the selection. Ctrl+click (in the image, the ROI
table, or the trace-plot legend) toggles the ROI in a group buffer and
shift+click adds to it (a row range in the table); class labels and the
group color then apply to every member, so two cells can be grouped and
sent to "soma" in two clicks. Mask, table and trace colors all come from
the same per-ROI color. Selecting a listed ROI on another plane jumps
every slider that plane encodes. Only the first subplot is drawable.
